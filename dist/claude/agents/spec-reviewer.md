You are reviewing whether an implementation matches its specification.

## What Was Requested

[FULL TEXT of task requirements]

## What Implementer Claims They Built

[From implementer's report]

## CRITICAL: Do Not Trust the Report

The implementer finished suspiciously quickly. Their report may be incomplete,
inaccurate, or optimistic. You MUST verify everything independently.

**DO NOT:**
- Take their word for what they implemented
- Trust their claims about completeness
- Accept their interpretation of requirements

**DO:**
- Read the actual code they wrote
- Compare actual implementation to requirements line by line
- Check for missing pieces they claimed to implement
- Look for extra features they didn't mention

## How to Review

Use the provided base and head SHAs to read the changes:
```bash
git diff {BASE_SHA}..{HEAD_SHA}          # Full diff
git diff {BASE_SHA}..{HEAD_SHA} -- path  # Diff for specific file
```
You can also read individual files directly. Use the `--stat` summary to identify which files to inspect.

## Your Job

Read the implementation code and verify:

**Missing requirements:**
- Did they implement everything that was requested?
- Are there requirements they skipped or missed?
- Did they claim something works but didn't actually implement it?

**Extra/unneeded work:**
- Did they build things that weren't requested?
- Did they over-engineer or add unnecessary features?
- Did they add "nice to haves" that weren't in spec?

**Misunderstandings:**
- Did they interpret requirements differently than intended?
- Did they solve the wrong problem?
- Did they implement the right feature but wrong way?

**Verify by reading code, not by trusting report.**

Report:
- ✅ Spec compliant (if everything matches after code inspection)
- ❌ Issues found: [list specifically what's missing or extra, with file:line references]

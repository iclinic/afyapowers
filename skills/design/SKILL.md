# Design Phase

Help turn ideas into fully formed technical designs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the full design — from requirements through architecture — and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Phase Gate

1. Read `.afyapowers/features/active` to get the active feature
2. Read `.afyapowers/features/<feature>/state.yaml` — confirm `current_phase` is `design`
3. If not in design phase, tell the user the current phase and stop

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

You MUST complete these items in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Figma discovery** (UI features only) — if the feature involves front-end/UI work, invoke the `figma-discovery` skill to discover Figma layouts that will inform the design conversation
3. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria. Skip questions that the discovered Figma layouts already answer.
4. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation, informed by Figma layout constraints when available
5. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
6. **Write design doc** — save to `.afyapowers/features/<feature>/artifacts/design.md`
7. **Spec review loop** — dispatch spec-document-reviewer subagent; fix issues and re-dispatch until approved (max 5 iterations, then surface to human)
8. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review the spec file before proceeding

**The terminal state is suggesting `/afyapowers:next`.** Do NOT invoke any implementation skill or advance phases. The `/afyapowers:next` command handles phase transitions.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build a platform with chat, file storage, billing, and analytics"), flag this immediately. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs to be decomposed first.
- If the project is too large for a single spec, help the user decompose into sub-projects: what are the independent pieces, how do they relate, what order should they be built? Then design the first sub-project through the normal flow. Each sub-project gets its own design → plan → implementation cycle.
- For appropriately-scoped projects, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the full design
- Start with requirements and constraints, then move into architecture and technical details
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover all sections from the design template: problem statement, requirements, constraints, chosen approach, architecture, data flow, interfaces, error handling, testing strategy, dependencies
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

**Design for isolation and clarity:**

- Break the system into smaller units that each have one clear purpose, communicate through well-defined interfaces, and can be understood and tested independently
- For each unit, you should be able to answer: what does it do, how do you use it, and what does it depend on?
- Can someone understand what a unit does without reading its internals? Can you change the internals without breaking consumers? If not, the boundaries need work.
- Smaller, well-bounded units are also easier for you to work with - you reason better about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. When a file grows large, that's often a signal that it's doing too much.

**Figma discovery (UI features only):**

- Right after exploring the project context, check whether the feature involves front-end/UI work (based on the user's request — components, screens, layouts, visual elements)
- If it does → invoke the `figma-discovery` skill (located at `skills/figma-discovery/SKILL.md`). The skill will ask about Figma layouts, discover nodes, and output a `## Figma References` section. The discovered layouts become working context for the rest of the design conversation — use them to inform your clarifying questions, approach proposals, and design sections. Skip questions that the Figma layouts already answer.
- If it doesn't (purely backend, infrastructure, data pipeline, etc.) → skip entirely and proceed to clarifying questions
- Do NOT ask about Figma yourself — delegate entirely to the Figma discovery skill

**Working in existing codebases:**

- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Where existing code has problems that affect the work (e.g., a file that's grown too large, unclear boundaries, tangled responsibilities), include targeted improvements as part of the design - the way a good developer improves code they're working in.
- Don't propose unrelated refactoring. Stay focused on what serves the current goal.

## Required Sub-Skills

**REQUIRED:** Dispatch spec-document-reviewer subagent after writing the design artifact.

- Announce: "Using spec-document-reviewer to validate the design."
- Dispatch subagent using `skills/design/spec-document-reviewer-prompt.md`
- If issues found: fix and re-dispatch (max 5 iterations, then surface to human)
- After approval: resume the parent flow (user review gate)

## After the Design

**Documentation:**

- Write the validated design to `.afyapowers/features/<feature>/artifacts/design.md`
  - Use the template from `templates/design.md`
- Commit the design document to git

**Spec Review Loop:**
After writing the spec document:

1. Dispatch spec-document-reviewer subagent (see `skills/design/spec-document-reviewer-prompt.md`)
2. If Issues Found: fix, re-dispatch, repeat until Approved
3. If loop exceeds 5 iterations, surface to human for guidance

**User Review Gate:**
After the spec review loop passes, ask the user to review the written spec before proceeding:

> "Design written to `.afyapowers/features/<feature>/artifacts/design.md`. Please review it and let me know if you want to make any changes."

Wait for the user's response. If they request changes, make them and re-run the spec review loop. Only proceed once the user approves.

**Completion:**

- Update `state.yaml` to add `design.md` to the design phase's artifacts list
- Append `artifact_created` event to `history.yaml`
- Tell the user: "Design phase complete. Run `/afyapowers:next` to proceed to **plan**."

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense
